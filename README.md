# UBC ELEC 542 Coursework

My coursework for UBC ELEC 542 - Nanoscale Modelling and Simulations

## About This Repo

This is my coursework for the EECE 542 class, taken the second term of winter 2021. I make no guarantees for the accuracy of the solutions, so please keep that in mind when reviewing the work. The rendered PDFs as well as the original LaTeX of the assignments are present. Python was the main language used for the assignment solutions.

## Assignment 1

Analytically and numerically solving Schrodinger's equation for electrons in an infinite potential well.

## Assignment 2

Implementing and numerically solving exact restricted Hartree-Fock equations for the Helium atom and the Hydrogen molecule.
