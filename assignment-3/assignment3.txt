This is a direct follow-up to assignment 2. We are interested in solving the same two systems (hydrogen molecule and helium atom) as in that assignment and comparing the results with what we obtained there.

In this assignment, use the Roothaan equation. As basis functions, use two s-type, normalized Gaussian functions (with different values of α) centered on each atom. Note that you can choose whatever values of α you find most suitable for the two Gaussian functions on each atom. Play around with a few different α values to see which ones give you the most reasonable answers. If you are ambitious, include additional basis functions.

a) [4 points] Describe your approach and show the steps of your derivation all the way to obtaining the matrix equation.

b) [4 points] Write a computer code to implement what you built in part a.

c) [4 points] Plot several molecular orbitals and give their associated energies for the helium atom. Also calculate the total energy of the system. Discuss your results.

d) [4 points] Plot several molecular orbitals and give their associated energies for the hydrogen molecule. Also calculate the total energy of the system (not including the nucleus-nucleus interaction). Discuss your results.

e) [4 points] Compare your results of both the above exercise and what you obtained in assignment 2 together and also with values available from the literature, and what you obtain using a commercial program such as Gaussian (run through ABACUS, for example).
