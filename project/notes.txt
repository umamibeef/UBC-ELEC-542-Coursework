Possible optimization target: pyscf, numint_uniform_grid.c
 * integration is performed by multigrid.py
    - specifically, the eval_mat function
    - the numeric integration function name to call is constructed and stored
      in eval_fn (e.g. eval_fn = 'NUMINTeval_' + xctype.lower() + lattice_type)
    - the numerical integration is passed as the first paramter of
      libdft.NUMINT_fill2c
    - a test function exists: test_eval_mat, found in test_numint.py and test_r_numint.py
    - BLAS and LAPACK libraries are required to build pyscf (sudo apt install libblas-dev liblapack-dev)
