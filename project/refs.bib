abstract={The major goal of quantum chemistry is to obtain solutions to atomic and molecular Schrodinger equations. The most uniformly successful family of methods begins with the simplest possible n-electron wave function satisfying the Pauli antisymmetry principle—a Slater determinant of one-electron functions χi(r,ω) called “spinorbitals.” Each spinorbital is a product of a molecular orbital and a spinfunction. The molecular orbital are found by the self-consistent-field (SCF) procedure. The Hartree-Fock (HF) and Kohn-Sham density functional (KS) theories are both of this type, as are their many simplified variants. The result of any quantum chemical procedure is the molecular energy, parametrically determined by the nuclear geometry. To locate equilibrium and transition structures, usually the first derivatives of the energy are computed with respect to nuclear motion; harmonic vibrational frequencies can be obtained if second derivatives are available and third and higher derivatives are needed for higher-level studies of potential surfaces. It is noted that the nth derivatives of the integrals are required to compute nth-derivatives of the energy. This chapter focuses on the efficient generation of integrals and their nth-derivatives.},

abstract={This is the third edition of the successful text-reference book that covers computational chemistry. It features changes to the presentation of key concepts and includes revised and new material with several expanded exercises at various levels such as 'harder questions' for those ready to be tested in greater depth - this aspect is absent from other textbooks in the field. Although introductory and assuming no prior knowledge of computational chemistry, it covers the essential aspects of the subject. There are several introductory textbooks on computational chemistry; this one is (as in its previous editions) a unique textbook in the field with copious exercises (and questions) and solutions with discussions. Noteworthy is the fact that it is the only book at the introductory level that shows in detail yet clearly how matrices are used in one important aspect of computational chemistry. It also serves as an essential guide for researchers, and as a reference book.<;This is the first textbook on Computational Chemistry to genuinely cover the basics. This corrected second edition contains new material which includes solvent effects, the treatment of singlet diradicals, and the fundamentals of computational chemistry.;This work provides an overview of computational chemistry, explaining the basic underlying theory at a meaningful level that is not beyond beginners. The large number of references should make this book useful not only to undergraduates but also to graduate students and researchers.;},
