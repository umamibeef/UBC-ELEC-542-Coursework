abstract={Electronic Structure Calculations on Graphics Processing Units: From Quantum Chemistry to Condensed Matter Physics provides an overview of computing on graphics processing units (GPUs), a brief introduction to GPU programming, and the latest examples of code developments and applications for the most widely used electronic structure methods. The book covers all commonly used basis sets including localized Gaussian and Slater type basis functions, plane waves, wavelets and real-space grid-based approaches. The chapters expose details on the calculation of two-electron integrals, exchange-correlation quadrature, Fock matrix formation, solution of the self-consistent field equations, calculation of nuclear gradients to obtain forces, and methods to treat excited states within DFT. Other chapters focus on semiempirical and correlated wave function methods including density fitted second order Møller-Plesset perturbation theory and both iterative and perturbative single- and multireference coupled cluster methods. Electronic Structure Calculations on Graphics Processing Units: From Quantum Chemistry to Condensed Matter Physics presents an accessible overview of the field for graduate students and senior researchers of theoretical and computational chemistry, condensed matter physics and materials science, as well as software developers looking for an entry point into the realm of GPU and hybrid GPU/CPU programming for electronic structure calculations.;"Electronic Structure Calculations on Graphics Processing Units: From Quantum Chemistry to Condensed Matter Physics provides an overview of computing on graphics processing units (GPUs), a brief introduction to GPU programming, and the latest examples of code developments and applications for the most widely used electronic structure methods.

title={Analysis of High Performance Scientific Programming Workflows},
abstract={Substantial time is spent on building, optimizing and maintaining large-scale software that is run on supercomputers. However, little has been done to utilize overall resources efficiently when it comes to including expensive human resources. The community is beginning to acknowledge that optimizing the hardware performance such as speed and memory bottlenecks contributes less to the overall productivity than does the development lifecycle of high-performance scientific applications. Researchers are beginning to look at overall scientific workflows for high performance computing. Scientific programming productivity is measured by time and effort required to develop, configure, and maintain a simulation experiment and its constituent parts, together with the time to get to the solution when the programs are executed. There is no systematic framework by means of which scientific programming productivity of the available tools can be evaluated. We propose an evaluation approach that compares programming workflows to identify productivity bottlenecks and suboptimal paths as well as productivity gains. Based on a set of predefined criteria we can evaluate both short-term and long-term productivity criteria. We use these results to suggest improvements to the programming environment or tools. This thesis includes three studies of scientific programming workflows: 1) We apply our evaluation approach to two case studies involving the use of numerical libraries. 2) We evaluate GPU programming models using software engineering complexity metrics. 3) We evaluate use of a high level directive based programming model and a source-to-source compiler with respect to productivity of programming FPGAs using a computational chemistry code. We compare the programmability and performance of the FPGA port with the GPU port of the same code.},

abstract={This paper presents an FPGA implementation of a calculation module for a finite sum of the exponential products (orbital function). The module is composed of several specially designed floating-point modules which are, fully pipelined and optimized for high speed performance. The hardware implementation revealed significant speed-up for the finite sum of the exponential products calculation ranging from 2.5x to 20x in comparison to the CPU. The orbital function is a computationally critical part of the Hartree-Fock algorithm. The presented approach aims to increase the performance of the part of the quantum chemistry computational system by employing FPGA-based accelerator. Several issues are addressed such as an identification of proper code fragments, porting a part of the Hartree-Fock algorithm to FPGA, data precision adjustment and data transfer overheads. The authors’ intention was also to make hardware application of the orbital function universal and easily attachable to different systems.},
